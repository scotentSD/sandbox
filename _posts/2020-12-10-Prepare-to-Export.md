## Audience
- Unmoderated research with 6 participants on UserZoom 

## Hypotheses
- The Bloom LMS will be easy to use 
- The course will be reviewed as worthwhile 
- The components of the course will be viewed as worthwhile 

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: Partially supported
- The overall package is easy enough to use 
- Certain UI elements confused users. Large Blue Arrows were viewed as obvious calls to action. 
- The inclusion of a ‘News’ section also added to the complexity of using the system. 

### Hypothesis 2: Supported
- Everyone understood the intention of the course 
- Everyone understood the need for the course 

### Hypothesis 3: Not supported
- The initial “Welcome to Prepare to Export” video was fast, musical and confusing to everyone. It removed “Choice” from users about pacing and learning style. 
- The levels of hierarchy in the course menu confused users 
- The lack of a clear call to action of the course was also noted by all

## Recommendations
- Think about learning styles (audio, visual, written) 
- Ensure that nothing“removes that personal choices 
- Use this to support accessibility measures 
- Ensure that videos are captioned or transcribed.  
- Design courses on paper and test them before creating online versions. It is easier to change at this point. 
- Avoid adding elements such as News 
- Keep it simple
