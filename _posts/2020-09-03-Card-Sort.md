## Audience
- 30 users on UserZoom

## We we tested
- We conducted an open card sort test, asking users to group the existing content into categories that made sense to them to understand if the current IA of the site was working well
- We grouped the results into themes which gave us 5 key sections
- We then ran a follow-up closed card sort to validate the 5 sections and check users were easily able to sort the content using these new section
