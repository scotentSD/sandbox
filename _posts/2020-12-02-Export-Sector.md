## Audience
- 10 business owners/senior decision makers based in Scotland 
- Unmoderated testing on UserZoom 

## We were focusing on
- The design of the new export sector opportunities section (two options)

## Focus
- Is the content useful and easy to understand? 
- Does the layout make sense? 
- Which option to users prefer? 

## Results

- It was a 50/50 split between options 1 and 2, but the users who said they liked design 2 as their preference actually said they liked both, so this pushes it in favour of design 1
