## Audience
- Internal testing with 7 staff members 

## What we tested
- Updated version of the Export Compass tool 

## Results
- Most people found this new version easier to use 
- It's a powerful analytical tool, but people arenâ€™t sure how they would use it in their jobs 
- Information in the tool is too high-level to be useful 
- Clear training guidance is needed 

## Recommendations
- Add HS6 codes and additional SITC codes to allow users to drill down deeper into the trade data 
- Add guidance that explains how users can drill down deeper into the CRM data 
- Add a sector filter to the CRM section 
- Activate the 'Export to Excel' functionality 
- Add guidance about how to create bookmarks so users can come back to searches/markets that they use frequently 
- Set up ideation sessions with trade specialists to better understand what data they need access to in order to do their jobs better and see if this tool can deliver that
