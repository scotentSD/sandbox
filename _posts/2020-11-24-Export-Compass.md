## Audience
- Internal testing with 7 staff members 

## We were focusing on
- First version of the Export Compass tool 

## Hypotheses

- It will make peopleâ€™s jobs easier 
- It will make accessing data easier 
- The layout will make sense to people

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: Partially supported

- The fundamental components have the potential to make jobs easier for people BUT 
- The current Page Layout makes that too confusing unless you use it daily 

### Hypothesis 2: Supported

- The individual components are fantastic, and when understood, were routinely praised for their potential to make data easier to access, without having to go into a number of other systems 
- It does make accessing data easier 
- It does make accessing data faster

### Hypothesis 3: Not supported

- The page layouts made sense until they were used, and then the complication of what cross filters with what, quickly made them too confusing to be useful 
- Page filter was also confused with cross filtering. This would be evident on a simplified page but with the current layout it just added to the confusion. 
   
## Recommendations
- Use the current components in simplified layouts
