## Audience
- 10 business owners/senior decision makers based in Scotland 
- Unmoderated testing on UserZoom 

## We we tested
- The design and content in the new export delivery and documentation section

## Focus
- Is the content useful and easy to understand? 
- Is there anything on the page that doesnâ€™t make sense? 
- Is there anything missing? 
- What would users do next after reading this information? 

## Results
- Overall, the feedback on the page content and design was very positive with most participants finding it easy to navigate and understand 
- few comments were made about the lack of reference to Brexit and information specific to EU and non-EU shipping 
- Only one participant (slide 5) commented that they thought there were too many external links on the page, suggesting it's not an issue for the majority
